Their goal with their media campaign is to identify as many news articles that mention health and wellness as possible. \n","\n","This is called contextual advertising: finding the URLs that match the context in which you’d like your ad to be shown. If you want to learn more about contextual advertising, I humbly recommend my non-credit Digital Advertising Strategy specialization on Coursera!\n","\n","Your challenge now is to build a deep learning algorithm that predicts the probability that a news story is about health and wellness.
